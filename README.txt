python titanic_experiments.py



#titanic_experiments.py is for the experiments
#titanic_pickle.py is for model selection,
#you can just run python titanic_pickle.py to generate a pkl
#but you don't need to because I have the titanic_classifier.pkl in this folder
#This is just for you to see my code for model selection


#mnist codes work the same as above
